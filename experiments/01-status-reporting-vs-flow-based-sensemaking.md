# Experiment 2: Status Reporting vs Flow-Based Sensemaking

## Hypothesis
**Status meetings exist to preserve the plan, not to reveal reality — and therefore suppress learning about system constraints.**

Teams are not dishonest.  
They are responding rationally to what the meeting implicitly rewards.

---

## Current System Behaviour (Observed)

- Bi-weekly status meetings require:
  - progress narratives
  - explanation of variance
  - reassurance that the plan remains credible
- Delays are attributed to:
  - dependencies
  - resourcing
  - external blockers
- Work in progress and queueing are rarely addressed
- Plans are adjusted to preserve narrative consistency

---

## Intervention (Minimal System Change)

For one cycle, replace the status narrative with:

1. A single shared flow view, showing:
   - WIP
   - ageing work
   - blocked items
2. Prohibit:
   - percentage complete
   - forecasted completion dates
3. Ask only:
   - *Where is work not moving?*
   - *What constraint is making this rational?*
   - *What would need to change for flow to improve?*

No action items required.  
No commitments demanded.

## Signals to Observe (Not Targets)

- Frequency of WIP discussion
- Shift from blame to constraint language
- Willingness to acknowledge speculative planning
- Leadership behaviour: problem-solving vs reassurance-seeking

---

## What This Tests

- Whether status meetings are risk management theatre
- Whether visibility changes conversation quality
- Whether teams surface constraints once narrative pressure is removed

---

## Expected Outcome

If the hypothesis holds:
- WIP becomes discussable
- dependencies are reframed as structural design issues
- urgency gives way to diagnosis
- system-level improvement opportunities emerge

If it does not:
- the organisation learns that predictability is valued over truth

Again — learning occurs either way.

## EOS Framing Note

Neither experiment attempts to change behaviour directly.  
Both alter **what the system legitimises**.

If behaviour changes, it is evidence that:

> *people were already acting rationally — just under different constraints.*
