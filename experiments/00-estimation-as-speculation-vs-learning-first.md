# Experiment 1: Estimation as Speculation vs Learning First

## Hypothesis
**When uncertainty is treated as something to be estimated rather than learned, teams optimise for narrative coherence rather than outcome quality.**

Teams do not over-estimate because they are careless.  
They estimate because the system requires certainty before learning.

---

## Current System Behaviour (Observed)

- Quarterly planning involves:
  - multi-day estimation workshops
  - sizing epics and stories
  - sequencing work into roadmap-style plans
- No discovery or experimentation occurs during planning
- Assumptions are converted directly into commitments
- Plans degrade predictably over time, but are defended narratively

---

## Intervention (Minimal System Change)

For one quarterly cycle:

1. Remove estimation as a prerequisite for planning
2. Require that each proposed initiative includes:
   - a stated uncertainty or assumption
   - a concrete learning activity intended to reduce it  
     (e.g. prototype, spike, experiment, customer test)
3. Delay any delivery commitment until:
   - at least one learning activity has been completed
   - feasibility or viability has been *demonstrated*, not assumed

No new roles.  
No new process.  
Only a change in what the system accepts as “ready.”

## Signals to Observe (Not Targets)

- Time spent learning vs estimating
- Number of initiatives invalidated *before* commitment
- Quality of conversations (assumptions surfaced vs defended)
- Emotional tone: relief vs discomfort vs resistance

---

## What This Tests

- Whether estimation was being used as a *substitute for learning*
- Whether teams behave differently when learning is legitimised
- Whether leadership tolerance for uncertainty changes when evidence appears

---

## Expected Outcome

If the hypothesis holds:
- teams shift effort from speculation to discovery
- fewer but better-founded commitments emerge
- planning becomes shorter, not longer
- “missed estimates” conversations disappear

If it does not:
- the organisation learns that certainty is valued over learning — explicitly

Either outcome produces useful system truth.
