# When Outcomes Feel Impossible: Staying Outcome-Led While Building “Required” Features

Product managers are often told to “focus on outcomes, not outputs”.

Then they’re handed a replatforming initiative, a legacy replacement, or a greenfield product with a long list of _non-negotiable_ capabilities and think:

> “That’s nice in theory — but right now we just need to build the thing.”

This tension is real. It’s not a failure of mindset or maturity. It’s a feature of complex product work — especially when you’re rebuilding core capability before customers ever see a difference.

The challenge isn’t that features are required.\
The challenge is what we _let features represent_.

***

### Why feature delivery takes over (and why it’s rational)

In early product development — particularly when displacing a legacy system — outcomes are often **temporarily invisible**.

You’re not yet trying to:

* change customer behaviour
* improve conversion
* increase retention
* move revenue

You’re trying to:

* recreate core capability
* establish technical viability
* integrate with existing systems
* avoid breaking what already works

In that context, feature lists feel:

* concrete
* safe
* explainable to stakeholders
* easy to track in status reports

So teams naturally start reporting progress like this:

> “Payments integration: 60% complete”\
> “User management: delivered”\
> “Reporting module: in progress”

This isn’t laziness or cargo-cult delivery.\
It’s how people cope when outcomes aren’t yet measurable.

The problem is what happens next.

***

### The trap: when necessary features become the definition of progress

Once features become the unit of progress:

* learning becomes incidental
* changing direction becomes costly
* stopping becomes failure
* plans harden prematurely

Teams start optimising for _completion_, not _understanding_.

And because these features really are required, no one notices the shift until much later — when the product technically works but is hard to change, slow to evolve, or misaligned with real needs.

This is how outcome-driven intent quietly collapses into output-driven execution.

***

### The reframing: outcomes don’t disappear — they move

When customer outcomes can’t yet be measured, **the outcome of the work changes**.

Early in a product’s life, especially during replatforming, the meaningful outcomes are often:

* reduced uncertainty
* retired risks
* validated assumptions
* unlocked future options

The feature is not the outcome.\
The feature is the _means_ by which one of those outcomes is achieved.

For example:

| Feature on the plan        | Outcome the PM should care about                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build payments integration | Reduce uncertainty about handling real transactions end-to-end |
| Implement user management  | Prove access control won’t constrain future extension          |
| Rebuild reporting          | Demonstrate parity without locking in legacy assumptions       |

The work doesn’t change.\
What changes is **what success means**.

### How product managers stay outcome-led without denying reality

#### 1. Treat features as hypotheses, not commitments

Instead of framing work as:

> “These features are required before we can measure outcomes”

Reframe it as:

> “These features are our current best guesses for unlocking future outcomes.”

That single shift opens up better PM questions:

* What assumption does this feature test?
* What risk does it reduce?
* What would cause us to change approach?
* What do we expect to learn by building it?

If you can’t answer those, the feature has become an output — not a learning vehicle.

***

#### 2. Sequence work by risk, not completeness

Legacy replacement plans often aim for coverage:

> “Have we rebuilt everything yet?”

Outcome-led PMs sequence by **uncertainty**:

* architectural unknowns
* integration fragility
* performance risk
* operational complexity

So instead of:

> “Finish all payment features”

You focus on:

> “Can we process one real transaction, under realistic conditions, safely?”

That still requires building features — but the outcome is **confidence**, not ticked boxes.

***

#### 3. Make interim outcomes explicit in reporting

If status updates only list features, teams will optimise for feature delivery.

PMs can change this by reporting:

* risks retired
* assumptions invalidated
* unknowns turned into knowns
* constraints removed for future work

This doesn’t remove features from the report — it reframes them as _evidence_.

***

#### 4. Separate capability outcomes from customer outcomes

In replatforming work, the near-term outcome is often:

> “The organisation can now change faster and more safely.”

That is a real outcome — just not a customer-visible one yet.

Strong PMs are explicit about which horizon they’re working in:

* **Now:** capability and learning outcomes
* **Next:** behavioural and value outcomes

Problems arise when these horizons are blurred or implicitly judged by the wrong criteria.

***

### Is it inevitable that feature lists appear?

Yes.

What’s not inevitable is letting feature lists answer the question:

> “Are we making progress?”

High-performing product teams still build lots of features early.\
They just never let features be the thing that _proves_ progress.

Progress is proven by:

* growing understanding
* shrinking uncertainty
* increasing option value

Features are how you get there — not how you know you’ve arrived.

***

### The uncomfortable truth for product managers

When teams say:

> “We just need to deliver these features first”

What they often mean is:

> “We don’t yet have permission to treat learning as success.”

Outcome-led product management doesn’t deny the reality of early capability work.

It insists that **even then**, progress is measured by what the organisation now understands — not just by what it has built.

That’s how you build the foundation _without becoming trapped by it_.
