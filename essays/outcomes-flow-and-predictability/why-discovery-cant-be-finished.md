# Why Discovery Can’t Be Finished

Product Managers are often expected to “finish discovery” before delivery begins.

Requirements should be clear.\
Dependencies understood.\
Risks identified.\
Estimates credible.

This expectation is understandable — and deeply misleading.

In complex product environments, discovery cannot be finished in advance because **the information that matters most only appears through doing the work**.

This essay explains why that is the case, why front-loaded discovery persists anyway, and how continuous discovery changes both planning and behaviour without abandoning discipline.

***

### The Appeal of Finished Discovery

Big Up-Front Discovery (BUFD) feels responsible.

It promises:

* early clarity
* reduced risk
* predictable delivery
* fewer surprises downstream

For PMs, BUFD provides something else that matters just as much:\
**defensibility**.

If discovery is “done”, then plans can be justified, timelines committed, and uncertainty reframed as execution risk. The organisation feels safer.

The problem is not that BUFD is lazy or naïve.\
The problem is that it **confuses analysis with learning**.

***

### Why Discovery Breaks Down in Practice

BUFD assumes that the hardest questions can be answered before meaningful delivery begins.

In reality, the highest-value unknowns tend to be:

* technical feasibility under real constraints
* integration complexity across legacy systems
* performance and reliability at scale
* hidden dependencies between teams or platforms
* user behaviour once exposed to real solutions
* organisational friction introduced by the change itself

These are not “researchable” away.

They only surface when:

* code is written
* integrations are attempted
* users interact with working systems
* operational realities apply pressure

In EOM terms, BUFD **borrows certainty** where certainty must be **earned**.

***

### What “Continuous Discovery” Actually Means

Continuous discovery does not mean endless research or lack of commitment.

It means accepting a different premise:

> Learning is not a phase.\
> It is an ongoing system behaviour.

Under continuous discovery:

* discovery and delivery are interleaved
* assumptions are expected to be invalidated
* plans tighten as evidence accumulates
* commitments strengthen progressively
* changing direction is normal, not exceptional

Discovery doesn’t end when delivery starts.\
It **changes shape**.

***

### How This Shows Up in OKRs

The difference between BUFD and Continuous Discovery is often clearest in how OKRs are framed.

#### BUFD-Flavoured OKRs (Outcome-Wrapped Outputs)

**Objective:** Deliver the new payments platform by Q4\
**Key Results:**

* Complete requirements sign-off by end of Q1
* Build and integrate payment APIs
* Migrate 80% of users to the new platform

What’s happening here:

* learning is treated as something to finish early
* delivery progress is used as a proxy for value
* uncertainty is hidden behind execution milestones
* changing direction threatens the plan

These OKRs reward _compliance with intent_, not learning.

***

#### Continuous Discovery–Aligned OKRs

**Objective:** Reduce payment failures and operational risk during platform migration

**Key Results:**

* Validate performance and failure modes of the new platform under real transaction loads
* Demonstrate safe dual-running capability for priority customer segments
* Reduce mean time to detect and recover from payment errors during migration
* Establish evidence-based criteria for scaling migration beyond early cohorts

What’s different:

* outcomes are framed around behaviour and risk, not delivery
* delivery work exists, but as a means to learn
* learning continues throughout migration
* commitment scales with confidence, not hope

Here, discovery is not “done” — it is **institutionalised**.

***

### The PM Role Shift This Requires

Under BUFD, the PM’s job is to:

* define requirements
* manage scope
* sequence delivery
* protect the plan

Under continuous discovery, the PM’s job becomes something more subtle and more valuable:

* articulate assumptions explicitly
* identify where confidence is borrowed rather than earned
* design work to collapse the riskiest unknowns first
* keep commitments provisional until learning justifies them
* make learning legible to governance and leadership

This is not less accountability.\
It is **more honest accountability**.

***

### “But Some Features Are Known”

A common objection sounds reasonable:

> “We know we need these features — this is a replacement system.”

Often true.

What’s usually _not_ known:

* how long integration will take in a new architecture
* where legacy assumptions break
* which edge cases dominate effort
* how operational load shifts behaviour
* where the organisation itself becomes the constraint

Knowing _what_ is required does not mean knowing _how_, _when_, or _at what cost_.

Continuous discovery acknowledges this without pretending otherwise.

***

### The Cost of Pretending Discovery Is Finished

When organisations insist that discovery ends up front:

* learning is suppressed once delivery starts
* bad news travels slowly
* plans are defended instead of updated
* risk accumulates invisibly
* PMs become translators of certainty rather than designers of learning

The system optimises for reassurance, not outcomes.

***

### In Summary

Discovery cannot be finished because:

* the most important unknowns emerge through action
* complex systems respond in non-linear ways
* organisational behaviour itself changes the problem
* certainty must be earned, not declared

Continuous discovery does not mean indecision.\
It means **sequencing learning before irreversibility**.

For PMs operating under EOM, success is not finishing discovery.

It is **designing the system so learning continues until confidence is deserved**.

That is how outcomes improve without pretending the future is knowable.
