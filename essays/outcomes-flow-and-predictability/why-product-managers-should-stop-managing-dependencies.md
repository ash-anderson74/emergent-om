# Why Product Managers Should Stop “Managing Dependencies”

Product managers are often expected to answer impossible questions early:

* _What are the dependencies?_
* _How risky is this plan?_
* _Can we commit with confidence?_

These questions are reasonable — but the way organisations expect them to be answered is not.

In complex product environments, dependencies do not behave like items on a checklist. They behave like **relationships**, **queues**, **decisions**, and **delays** — none of which can be fully understood without interaction.

***

### Why Dependency Identification Fails PMs

The traditional approach assumes that:

* dependencies are stable
* risk can be enumerated
* effort can be inferred
* confidence precedes action

This puts PMs in a bind.

If they surface uncertainty honestly, they appear unprepared.\
If they present a polished plan, they absorb risk personally.

Dependency lists become a coping mechanism.

They create the appearance of due diligence while silently transferring uncertainty into the future.

***

### What PMs Actually Control

PMs do not control most dependencies.

They _do_ control:

* where attention is placed
* what gets tested first
* how uncertainty is framed
* whether learning is legitimised
* when the organisation commits

The mistake is treating dependencies as coordination problems rather than **learning problems**.

***

### A Better Question to Ask Early

Instead of:

> _“What are all the dependencies?”_

Ask:

> **“Which assumption, if wrong, would most damage our ability to proceed?”**

That question reframes planning from reassurance to discovery.

***

### Learning Before Commitment Is the PM Skill

In EOM terms, PMs create value early by:

* articulating assumptions explicitly
* identifying where confidence is borrowed
* designing cheap experiments to reduce uncertainty
* sequencing work to collapse risk first
* resisting false certainty

This is not indecision.\
It is disciplined risk management.

***

### Why This Matters in Migration and Replacement Work

Migration projects feel “safe” because the feature set is known.

But risk hides in:

* data quality
* edge cases
* performance under load
* organisational readiness
* integration behaviour
* operational failure modes

Knowing _what_ must exist is not the same as knowing _how hard_ it will be to make it work **here**.

Only exposure reveals that.

***

### The PM Reframe

The PM role is not to:

* predict delivery
* guarantee timelines
* manage dependencies on paper

It is to:

* surface uncertainty
* protect learning
* stage commitment
* help the organisation make better decisions sooner

This requires courage — and a system that does not punish it.

***

### Why Organisations Resist This Shift

Because learning creates moments of decision.

And decisions create exposure.

Plans delay accountability.\
Evidence demands it.

***

### In Closing

Dependencies do not become manageable when they are documented.

They become manageable when they are **experienced early, cheaply, and deliberately**.

When PMs are allowed to shift from dependency management to dependency exposure:

* plans improve
* confidence becomes earned
* surprises shrink
* and delivery accelerates — not because people try harder, but because reality is faced sooner

That is not weaker planning.

It is **planning that respects complexity**.
