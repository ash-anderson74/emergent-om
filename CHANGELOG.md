# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Emergent Operating Model (EOM)** are documented in this file.

EOM is a specification, not a product.  
Changes reflect learning, clarification, and synthesis rather than “feature delivery”.

## [v1.0] — Frozen Emergent Operating Model v1

### Status

**Emergent Operating Model v1 is frozen.**

This release represents a complete, coherent operating model for adaptability in complex socio-technical environments.  
Further evolution is governed by the **EOM Evolution Policy**.

---

### Added

- Formal **Emergent Operating Model v1 freeze**
- Defined governance and evolution policy for post-v1 changes
- Explicit articulation of **system invariants** that define compatibility with EOM
- Completed **Specification**, including:
  - Values and principles
  - System invariants and boundaries
  - Core operating domains
  - Operating cadence and feedback loops
  - Flow and learning model
  - Governance and funding model
  - Roles and accountabilities
  - Adoption and evolution guidance
  - Explicit “when not to use EOM” boundaries
- Fully articulated **Quarterly Learning Cycle**, integrating:
  - Strategic intent and alignment
  - Discovery, delivery, and validation
  - Reflection and system improvement
  - *Slowification* as a deliberate design choice
- Completed **Field Guide**, covering:
  - Outcome-oriented strategy
  - Funding as a learning system
  - Flow as a diagnostic signal, not a target
  - Team autonomy and interaction boundaries
  - Improvement as deliberate system work
  - Aspirational outcomes vs. high-integrity commitments
- EOM-aligned **Practice Playbooks** providing concrete but non-prescriptive guidance, including:
  - OKRs in EOM
  - Continuous discovery
  - Lean Kata for system-level improvement
  - Flow metrics as diagnostic instruments
  - Adaptive funding and metered investment
  - Strategic alignment using Lean Value Trees, OKRs, and Portfolio Kanban
  - The EOM Quarterly Learning Cycle
- Completed **Patterns Library (v1)** describing recurring system conditions
- Completed **Anti-Patterns Library (v1)** documenting reliable failure modes
- Expanded **Essays** for sense-making and guardrail setting, including:
  - How EOM Avoids the Illusion of Alignment
  - Why Team Structure Emerges from Constraints
  - How to Design a System Where Learning Governs Behaviour
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key design choices, including:
  - Outcome-based planning over output-based planning
  - Rejection of deterministic planning by default
  - Adaptive funding over deterministic budgeting
  - Treating flow metrics as signals, not targets
- Explanatory essays clarifying what “operating model” means in an organisational context
- Introduction of the **EOM component relationship model** as an interpretive aid
- Narrative guidance on reading diagrams without treating them as implementation artefacts
- Improved cross-space navigation across Specification, Field Guide, Essays, Patterns, and References
- Explicit articulation of EOM’s **core conceptual anchor**

### Notes

This release represents a synthesis of repeated patterns observed across:

- Lean and systems thinking
- DevOps and flow-based delivery
- Product discovery and outcome-driven strategy
- Organizational design and governance literature

Emergent Operating Model v1 intentionally resists:

- prescriptive practices
- maturity models
- certification schemes
- deterministic scaling frameworks
- compliance-driven transformation models

Its value lies in **coherence, restraint, and clarity**, not completeness.

## [v0.1] — Initial Public Specification (Archived)

### Added

- Initial EOM intent, scope, and positioning
- Early rejection of deterministic planning as a default
- Outcome-driven planning principles (Lean Value Trees, OKRs)
- Early operating-model framing
- Initial articulation of core domains
- Early quarterly cadence with embedded slowification
- Coaching-led governance concepts
- Adaptive funding and portfolio flow ideas
- Alignment with Lean and DevOps principles
- Initial role patterns
- Early non-goals and anti-patterns

### Notes

This version served as an exploratory synthesis intended to invite critique, learning, and refinement.  
It has been superseded by the frozen v1 specification.

## Versioning Guidelines

- **Major versions (v1.0, v2.0):**  
  Conceptual or structural shifts that materially change the operating model

- **Minor versions (v1.x):**  
  Clarifications, refinements, or extensions that preserve core intent

- **Patch versions (v1.x.y):**  
  Editorial changes, navigation improvements, or reference updates only

---

## Forward Look

Emergent Operating Model v1 is frozen.

Future exploration may occur through essays, patterns, or external experimentation and may inform potential v2 directions.  
No commitments are made at this time.
