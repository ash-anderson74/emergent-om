# Pattern: Adaptive Funding Over Deterministic Budgeting

### Intent

Align investment decisions with learning under uncertainty, rather than locking organisations into commitments based on speculative plans.

### Context

This pattern applies in environments where:

* outcomes cannot be predicted reliably upfront
* work spans multiple quarters
* value emerges through discovery and iteration

Traditional annual budgeting assumes certainty that does not exist in these domains.

### System Problem

When funding is allocated upfront and tied to scope:

* learning threatens continuation
* stopping early is punished
* sunk cost bias dominates decisions
* bad investments persist too long

Funding becomes a mechanism for enforcing plans rather than adapting to evidence.

### Forces at Play

* Annual financial cycles
* Capital allocation governance
* Desire for predictability and control
* Fear of appearing indecisive

These forces favour irreversible commitment.

### EOM Position

This pattern expresses the EOM invariants of:

* **Incremental and Reversible Commitment**
* **Governance as Sensing, Not Control**
* **Evidence Over Opinion**

It ensures that **funding remains a learning loop**, not a locking mechanism.

### The Pattern

Investment is treated as a **series of conditional decisions**, not a one-time approval.

Funding:

* is released in tranches
* is contingent on learning, not delivery
* can be redirected or withdrawn without stigma

The question governing funding decisions becomes:

> “What did we learn, and what does that justify doing next?”

### Example

Instead of:

> “Approve £5m to deliver Programme X”

The system frames:

> “Approve £500k to test the riskiest assumptions behind Programme X, with explicit criteria for continuation or termination.”

Continuation is earned through evidence, not momentum.

### Signals This Pattern Is Holding

* Teams can recommend stopping without reputational damage
* Funding decisions reference learning explicitly
* Portfolio composition changes over time
* Fewer “too big to stop” initiatives

### Anti-Patterns

* Fixed annual budgets in high-uncertainty domains
* Funding tied to delivery milestones
* Treating spending as progress
* Learning reported separately from investment decisions

### Trade-offs

* Requires more frequent decision-making
* Feels uncomfortable to control-oriented cultures
* Demands financial literacy across leadership
