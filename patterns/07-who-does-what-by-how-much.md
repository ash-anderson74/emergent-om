# Pattern: Who Does What By How Much

## Context

Organizations want to align teams around measurable outcomes, not just outputs. OKRs are adopted as a goal-setting framework, but many teams struggle to write OKRs that clearly express impact. Objectives often become vague aspirations, and Key Results drift into task lists or vanity metrics.

## Problem

- OKRs are written as outputs (e.g., “Launch feature X”) rather than outcomes.
- Key Results lack clarity on who is affected, what behaviour changes, and by how much.
- Teams find it hard to connect OKRs to strategic priorities and customer impact.

## Forces

- Stakeholders demand visibility and measurable progress.
- Teams want autonomy but need clarity on what success looks like.
- Pressure to deliver quickly leads to output-focused goals.
- Measuring behavioural change feels harder than tracking delivery milestones.

## Solution

Apply Seiden & Gothelf’s formula: Who + Does What + By How Much to craft outcome-focused Key Results.

1. Start with a strong Objective: Inspirational, qualitative, timeboxed, and specific.
2. Identify the biggest obstacle: What’s preventing success? This sharpens focus.
3. Write Key Results using the formula:  
  a. Who: Define the audience or user segment.  
  b. Does What: Specify the behaviour or action that signals success.  
  c. By How Much: Quantify the change that matters.  
4. Validate alignment: Ensure OKRs reflect strategic priorities and are achievable within the timebox.

### Example

- Objective: Improve customer onboarding experience.
- Key Result: New customers (Who) complete onboarding (Does What) within 3 days (By How Much).

## Result

- OKRs become outcome-driven and measurable.
- Teams gain clarity on what success looks like and why it matters.
- Leadership shifts from controlling outputs to enabling impact.
- Progress is tracked through meaningful behavioural and business changes, not feature delivery.
