# Pattern: Who Does What By How Much

### Context

EOM environments require goals that guide **learning under uncertainty**, not just execution.

OKRs are widely adopted to enable outcome-oriented thinking, but are frequently reduced to **feature plans with metrics attached**. When this happens, OKRs lose their function as learning instruments.

This pattern clarifies how OKRs function in EOM **before high-integrity commitment is possible**.

***

### Problem

Teams often write OKRs that:

* describe delivery activity rather than change
* assume outcomes rather than test them
* optimise reporting over learning
* create confidence theatre without evidence

The organisation appears outcome-driven while remaining behaviourally output-driven.

***

### Forces

* Leaders want measurable progress without micromanagement
* Teams need clarity while retaining autonomy
* Outcomes are harder to specify than features
* Pressure for predictability encourages premature certainty

***

### Solution

Frame aspirational OKRs as **explicit learning hypotheses** using the structure:

> **Who**\
> **Does What**\
> **By How Much**

This structure is not a formatting trick.\
It forces the team to make the underlying hypothesis explicit:

> _“If we do X, we believe Y behaviour will change by Z.”_

Aspirational OKRs are **not commitments**.\
They are vehicles for discovery.

### Example: Outcome Hypothesis vs Output Plan

#### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Feature-Centric OKRs

**Objective**\
Deliver the new payments platform

**Key Results**

* Build payment service
* Integrate with billing
* Migrate 60% of users
* Achieve 99.9% uptime

**What’s wrong**

* Assumes value is delivered by completion
* Measures work done, not impact
* Treats certainty as given
* Learning is incidental, not intentional

***

#### ✅ EOM Pattern: Aspirational, Hypothesis-Driven OKRs

**Objective**\
Reduce payment friction for existing customers

**Key Results**

* **80% of existing customers**\
  **complete a payment successfully**\
  **on first attempt**
* **Customer support tickets related to failed payments**\
  **reduce by 40%**
* **Median payment completion time**\
  **reduces from 45s to under 20s**

**What this enables**

* Makes success observable
* Keeps solution open
* Allows learning to invalidate assumptions
* Enables course correction without failure narrative

***

### Resulting Behaviour

* Teams seek evidence rather than reassurance
* Discovery and delivery interleave naturally
* Metrics regain their role as signals
* Learning becomes progress

***

### Trade-offs

* Requires discipline in phrasing
* Behavioural signals may lag delivery
* Stakeholders must tolerate ambiguity

These are **desirable tensions**, not flaws.

***

### EOM Relationship

* **Principle:** Learning Over Certainty
* **Invariant:** Incremental & Reversible Commitment
* **Cadence:** Pre-commitment learning within the EOM Learning Cycle
