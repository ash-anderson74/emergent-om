# Pattern: Who Does What By How Much

### Context

Organisations adopt outcome frameworks (e.g. OKRs) to escape output fixation.

### Problem

Outcomes are often articulated vaguely:

* aspirations replace hypotheses
* key results describe activity
* metrics track effort, not change
* learning is obscured by reporting

Outcomes exist in language, not behaviour.

### EOM Interpretation

An outcome is only useful if it **constrains decision-making**.

EOM treats outcomes as _testable hypotheses_ about system behaviour.

### Solution

Express outcomes as observable change using:

**Who → Does What → By How Much**

This framing forces clarity around:

* the affected actor
* the behavioural or capability shift
* the evidence threshold for learning

### Example

❌ _Improve onboarding experience_\
❌ _Deliver new onboarding flow_

✅ _New users complete first transaction within 24 hours, increasing from 40% to 55%_

The team is free to choose _how_ — but not free to avoid learning.

### Results

* outcomes constrain solution space without prescribing it
* metrics become learning signals
* teams adapt tactics without re-approval
* confidence grows through evidence

### Trade-offs

* harder conversations upfront
* delayed gratification vs delivery theatre
* requires leadership comfort with ambiguity

### Anti-Patterns

* outcome language with fixed scope
* numeric targets tied to reward
* pretending lagging indicators drive learning

### Relationship to EOM

* Anchors _Outcomes Over Outputs_
* Enables _Evidence Over Opinion_
* Supports _Adaptive Governance_
