# Pattern: Outcome Over Output

## Pattern: Outcome Over Output

### Intent

Ensure learning, not activity, governs investment and commitment in complex product environments.

### Context

Used when work outcomes cannot be predicted reliably upfront, and value emerges through interaction, feedback, and adaptation.

### System Problem

When output becomes the primary unit of planning and reward, organisations optimise for delivery volume rather than value or learning.

This leads to:

* feature accumulation without impact
* defensive scope commitments
* late discovery of risk
* slow adaptation when assumptions fail

### Forces at Play

* Budgeting requires scope
* Governance wants certainty
* Progress reporting rewards completion
* Status is attached to “shipping”

These forces make output the safest currency — even when it is misleading.

### EOM Position

This pattern expresses the EOM principles of:

* **Outcomes Over Outputs**
* **Hypothesis Over Assumption**
* **Evidence Over Opinion**

It protects the invariant that _learning must precede high-integrity commitment_.

### The Pattern

The system frames intent in terms of **problems to solve and changes to observe**, rather than features to deliver.

Outputs are treated as:

* hypotheses
* instruments of learning
* provisional means

Commitment increases only as evidence accumulates.

### Example

Instead of:

> “Deliver a new payments integration by Q3”

The system frames:

> “Enable customers to complete checkout with fewer failures, and learn which integration approach reduces error rates fastest.”

Multiple implementations may follow. Some may be abandoned early. All contribute learning.

### Signals This Pattern Is Holding

* Teams can stop work without penalty when learning invalidates assumptions
* Progress discussions focus on insight, not completion
* Output changes mid-cycle without governance escalation
* Metrics are explained, not defended

### Anti-Patterns

* Outcome-wrapped feature lists
* OKRs that restate projects
* “Success” declared at launch regardless of impact
* Learning framed as failure

### Trade-offs

* Progress feels less visible initially
* Requires leadership tolerance for ambiguity
* Harder to compare initiatives superficially
