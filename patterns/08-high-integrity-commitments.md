# Pattern: High Integrity Commitments

### Context

Not all work can remain exploratory.

Regulatory, contractual, safety, or market obligations sometimes require **guarantees**, not aspirations. EOM does not reject commitments — it **restricts when they are made**.

This pattern describes when OKRs legitimately transition from learning instruments to commitments.

***

### Problem

Organisations routinely treat all OKRs as commitments, regardless of uncertainty.

This leads to:

* defensive planning
* scope locking
* fear of revision
* delayed risk discovery
* erosion of trust

Commitments are made before confidence exists.

***

### Forces

* Leadership demands assurance
* Teams want to appear reliable
* Early certainty feels responsible
* Learning is misinterpreted as hesitation

***

### Solution

Use OKRs **differently** depending on certainty:

#### Two Modes of OKRs in EOM

| Mode                    | Purpose              | Nature      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| **Aspirational OKRs**   | Learning & discovery | Hypotheses  |
| **High-Integrity OKRs** | Guarantees           | Commitments |

High-integrity OKRs are only valid **after learning has reduced uncertainty**.

***

### When an OKR Becomes a Commitment

An OKR may be treated as a **high-integrity commitment** when:

* feasibility is evidenced
* major risks are retired
* scope is intentionally constrained
* adaptability loss is acknowledged
* dependencies are understood, not assumed

Until then, OKRs remain aspirational.

***

### Example: Same Work, Different Integrity

#### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Premature Commitment

**Objective**\
Migrate customers to the new platform

**Key Results**

* Migrate 70% of customers by Q3
* Decommission legacy platform

**Why this fails**

* Assumes migration effort and risk
* Forces delivery theatre
* Punishes learning
* Creates political pressure to continue

***

#### ✅ EOM Pattern: Learning → Commitment Transition

**Quarter 1 (Aspirational)**\
Objective: Understand feasibility of customer migration

* Identify top 5 migration risks
* Validate automated migration path for one segment
* Achieve <2% failure rate in pilot cohort

**Quarter 2 (High-Integrity Commitment)**\
Objective: Safely migrate core customer segments

* Migrate **50% of eligible customers**
* Maintain **no increase in support volume**
* Rollback capability remains available

Commitment is made **only after learning validates delivery**.

***

### Resulting Behaviour

* Confidence replaces confidence theatre
* Risk is addressed earlier
* Stopping or adjusting remains legitimate
* Trust increases system-wide

***

### Trade-offs

* Commitments appear later
* Leadership must tolerate learning phases
* Planning is evidence-gated

This is the cost of reliability in complexity.

***

### EOM Relationship

* **Principle:** Incremental & Reversible Commitment
* **Invariant:** Learning Precedes Commitment
* **Cadence:** Commitment events align with validated learning
