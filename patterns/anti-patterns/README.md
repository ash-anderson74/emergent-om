# Anti-Patterns

Anti-patterns describe **recurring failure modes** — approaches that appear reasonable, even sophisticated, but reliably undermine learning, flow, and outcomes over time.

They are included here to:

- make common mistakes explicit
- provide shared language for difficult conversations
- help organizations recognize self-inflicted constraints
- prevent well-intentioned practices from being misapplied

Anti-patterns are not critiques of people.
They are critiques of **system behavior**.

## How Anti-Patterns Should Be Used

Anti-patterns are diagnostic, not accusatory.

They are most useful when:

- something “looks right” but feels wrong
- progress exists without impact
- alignment exists without learning
- delivery accelerates while outcomes stagnate
- governance increases but confidence does not

If you recognize an anti-pattern, the goal is not correction by mandate,
but inquiry into **why the system rewards it**.

## Relationship to Patterns and Practices

Each anti-pattern mirrors or distorts a legitimate pattern.

- Patterns describe conditions under which learning and value emerge
- Anti-patterns describe how those conditions collapse

Anti-patterns often arise when:

- practices are adopted without shared operating logic
- metrics are used as controls rather than signals
- certainty is favored over learning
- intent is replaced by compliance

## A Note on Blame

If you see an anti-pattern at work:

- assume good intent
- investigate incentives and constraints
- avoid searching for individual fault

Anti-patterns persist because systems make them rational.

## In Summary

Anti-patterns help answer a different question than patterns.

Patterns ask: *What tends to work?*  
Anti-patterns ask: *Why does this keep failing?*

Use them to see more clearly — not to judge.
