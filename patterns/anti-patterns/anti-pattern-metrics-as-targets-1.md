# Anti-Pattern: Metrics as Targets

**Description**

Measures introduced to create visibility or learning are **repurposed as performance targets**.

Once this happens, metrics cease to function as signals of system health and instead become mechanisms of control, comparison, and reward allocation.

Learning degrades while apparent certainty increases.

***

**Why It Emerges**

This anti-pattern emerges when organisations:

* equate accountability with numeric certainty
* require defensible decisions under scrutiny
* tie metrics to reward, reputation, or funding
* operate under fear of being wrong rather than curiosity about reality

Using metrics as targets feels responsible — especially in regulated or high-risk environments — because it creates **legibility**, even when it destroys insight.

***

**System Effects**

When metrics become targets:

* behaviour adapts to the metric rather than the system
* negative signals are delayed, softened, or hidden
* experimentation becomes risky
* stopping work becomes failure
* local optimisation accelerates
* learning slows or disappears

The organisation gains **plausible deniability**, not safety.

***

**What It Prevents**

* honest reporting of uncertainty
* early discovery of failure modes
* adaptive decision-making
* reversible commitments
* meaningful governance conversations

Metrics no longer ask _“what is happening?”_\
They ask _“how do we look?”_

***

**Signals You’re in This Anti-Pattern**

* “We hit the numbers, but the outcome wasn’t what we expected.”
* “Let’s just get back to green.”
* Metrics are reviewed before learning is discussed.
* Teams optimise dashboards faster than value.
* Bad news appears late, framed as external.

***

**EOM Position**

In the Emergent Operating Model:

> **Any metric attached to reward will be optimised — regardless of its relationship to value.**

Metrics are valid **only as learning instruments**.\
Once used for enforcement, they stop being diagnostic.
