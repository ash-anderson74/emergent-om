# Pattern: Delivery vs Product Management – Avoiding the Control Trap

### Context

Organisations distinguish between “delivery” and “product” roles to balance execution and value.

As scale increases, pressure for predictability rises.

### Problem

Delivery management often drifts into **control management**:

* commitments harden before learning
* plans substitute for evidence
* progress is reported through completion
* uncertainty is hidden rather than explored

Product intent becomes subordinated to delivery certainty.

### EOM Diagnosis

This is not role failure.\
It is **system-induced behaviour**.

When:

* delivery certainty is rewarded
* deviation is penalised
* governance demands forecasts
* status reporting replaces sensing

Then control becomes the rational strategy.

### Forces

* executive demand for confidence
* bonus schemes tied to delivery
* dependency-driven planning
* low tolerance for narrative change

Together, these forces collapse learning into scheduling.

### Solution

Reframe delivery and product management around **risk reduction and learning throughput**.

In EOM:

* Product management owns _problem framing and hypothesis quality_
* Delivery management owns _option creation and constraint removal_
* Planning becomes a learning agenda, not a promise

Both functions are accountable to _evidence generation_, not output completion.

### Example

Instead of asking:

> “Can we deliver these five features this quarter?”

EOM asks:

> “What must we learn before any commitment here becomes responsible?”

Delivery sequencing follows **risk collapse**, not dependency charts.

### Result

* earlier exposure of technical and organisational constraints
* fewer late surprises
* delivery pace stabilises through learning, not pressure

### Anti-Patterns

* dual-track in name only
* output-wrapped outcomes
* delivery metrics detached from customer change

### Relationship to EOM

* Reinforces _Hypothesis Over Assumption_
* Requires _Incremental & Reversible Commitment_
* Depends on _Governance as Sensing_
