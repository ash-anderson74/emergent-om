# Pattern: Team Topologies

## Context

Your organization struggles with delivery speed and coordination. Teams are organized around projects or technologies, leading to frequent handoffs, unclear ownership, and high cognitive load. Dependencies slow progress, and collaboration feels reactive rather than intentional.

## Problem

Traditional team structures create bottlenecks and silos. Work stalls because teams depend on others for critical capabilities. Coordination overhead grows as systems scale, reducing adaptability and increasing frustration.

## Forces

- Stakeholders want predictability and speed.
- Teams need clarity of ownership and reduced cognitive load.
- Dependencies are inevitable but unmanaged.
- Scaling amplifies complexity and communication challenges.

## Solution

Apply Team Topologies principles to design team structures for fast flow and clear ownership. Organize teams into four types—Stream-Aligned, Enabling, Platform, and Complicated Subsystem—and define interaction modes (Collaboration, X-as-a-Service, Facilitating). Use topology tune-ups to adapt structures as systems evolve. Empower stream-aligned teams to own end-to-end delivery of customer value, supported by enabling and platform teams that reduce friction.

## Result

Teams experience fewer handoffs and clearer boundaries. Cognitive load decreases, enabling faster decision-making and higher autonomy. Dependencies are managed through designed interactions, not ad hoc coordination. Delivery accelerates, and adaptability improves as team structures evolve with the system.
