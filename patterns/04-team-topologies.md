# Pattern: Team Design Emerges from Constraints (EOM)

### Context

As organisations scale product development, coordination costs rise and delivery slows. Leaders seek clarity by defining team structures, roles, and interaction models.

Frameworks often prescribe team shapes and boundaries upfront.

### Problem

Predefined team structures frequently fail to deliver intended benefits:

* dependencies multiply rather than reduce
* ownership becomes fragmented
* teams optimise locally while value degrades system-wide
* re-orgs become recurring interventions

Structure is treated as a _solution_, rather than a response to observed constraints.

### EOM Perspective

In the Emergent Operating Model, **team topology is not a design choice**.\
It is an _emergent property_ of system constraints.

Teams behave in ways that minimise:

* coordination latency
* decision risk
* dependency exposure
* accountability ambiguity

When constraints are misaligned, team boundaries calcify around safety rather than value.

### Forces

* Leaders want predictable delivery and accountability
* Teams seek autonomy and reduced handoffs
* Architecture introduces unavoidable coupling
* Governance creates implicit approval paths
* Funding models reinforce project boundaries

These forces act whether teams are deliberately designed or not.

### Solution

Design **constraints first**, and allow team structures to emerge.

In EOM this means:

* constrain work to outcome ownership, not project scope
* reduce dependency cost rather than plan around dependencies
* align funding to value streams, not initiatives
* treat coordination load as a leading risk signal
* redesign boundaries when learning stalls

Common team patterns (e.g. stream-aligned, platform, enabling teams) _may_ emerge — but are never mandated.

### Example

When a product team repeatedly escalates delivery blockers:

* EOM does **not** prescribe a “platform team”
* It asks:
  * What decisions are blocked?
  * What learning is delayed?
  * What dependency is unavoidable?

A platform capability may emerge — **because the system demands it**, not because a framework recommends it.

### Resulting Behaviours

* Teams own outcomes end-to-end
* Dependencies are surfaced early through delivery
* Team boundaries evolve as constraints change
* Re-orgs reduce in frequency and scope

### Anti-Patterns

* importing team models without matching constraints
* re-orgs as a substitute for system change
* treating topology as governance, not ergonomics

### Relationship to EOM

* Reinforces _Structural Coherence Over Uniformity_
* Depends on _Flow as Diagnostic_
* Enabled by _Adaptive Funding_
