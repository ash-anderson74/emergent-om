# Pattern: Confidence-Based Sizing

### Intent

To use sizing as a **signal of current understanding and risk**, rather than as a prediction of effort, duration, or capacity.

This pattern exists to prevent organisations from borrowing confidence, disguising uncertainty, or converting estimates into implicit commitments in complex product environments.

***

### Context

This pattern applies when:

* work involves uncertainty in _problem, solution, integration, or behaviour_
* delivery occurs within a socio-technical system, not a repeatable factory
* teams are expected to plan, prioritise, or sequence work before learning is complete
* estimates are routinely used to justify commitments, funding, or schedules

It is particularly relevant where:

* features are known, but outcomes are not
* legacy systems are being displaced or re-platformed
* new architectures, integrations, or customer behaviours are involved

***

### Problem

Traditional estimation practices treat **size as a proxy for effort, duration, or predictability**.

In complex environments this creates systemic distortion:

* uncertainty is hidden rather than surfaced
* optimistic assumptions are rewarded
* teams split work to satisfy planning rituals, not understanding
* estimates harden into expectations despite low confidence

As a result, planning artefacts create **illusory certainty**, while risk accumulates silently.

***

### Forces

* Leaders require predictability to manage accountability and exposure
* Teams feel pressure to appear confident and “ready”
* Planning cadence rewards completeness over honesty
* Estimation language is overloaded with implied promises
* Uncertainty is penalised socially or structurally

These forces make **false precision rational behaviour**.

***

### Solution

**Treat size as an indicator of confidence, not of work.**

Sizing answers this question:

> _“How well do we understand what this work entails right now?”_

Rather than:

> _“How long will this take?”_

In this pattern:

* size expresses **unknowns**, not effort
* large size legitimises **learning work**, not pressure
* shrinking size is evidence of **learning**, not delivery
* size has no direct relationship to scheduling or funding

T-shirt sizes (or equivalent coarse categories) are used deliberately to avoid false precision.

***

### Structure

#### Size reflects confidence gradients

Sizes represent progressively lower certainty:

* **Small** → problem and solution are well understood
* **Medium** → intent is clear, but assumptions remain
* **Large** → material uncertainty exists; learning is required
* **Extra-Large** → confidence is insufficient for commitment

Large sizes are not defects.\
They are **diagnostic signals**.

***

#### Size constrains commitment

In an EOM-aligned system:

* **Delivery commitment is gated by confidence**
* Learning work precedes high-integrity commitment
* Size does not justify deadlines, sequencing, or capacity claims

A size that remains large indicates a **system learning problem**, not a planning failure.

***

#### Size is local and non-comparative

Confidence-based sizing:

* is meaningful only to the team doing the work
* must not be normalised, aggregated, or benchmarked
* must not be used for performance evaluation

Cross-team size comparison erodes trust and reintroduces theatre.

***

### Resulting Context

When this pattern is operating:

* teams surface uncertainty earlier
* learning work becomes legitimate and protected
* delivery commitments occur later, but with higher integrity
* planning conversations shift from “when” to “what must we learn”
* flow improves as risk collapses earlier rather than later

Confidence increases through evidence, not assertion.

***

### Anti-Patterns Prevented

This pattern prevents:

* size being treated as a delivery promise
* estimates being converted into funding justifications
* artificial decomposition to appear predictable
* planning sessions that reward optimism over honesty
* reclassification of discovery work as “delivery”

***

### Failure Modes

This pattern collapses if:

* size is tied to deadlines or capacity plans
* large size triggers escalation rather than learning
* teams are pressured to “refine until small”
* leadership interprets size as competence
* size is audited, gamed, or standardised

In these conditions, confidence-based sizing becomes indistinguishable from traditional estimation.

***

### Diagnostic Questions

* What happens organisationally when something is sized **large**?
* Is the next step learning — or justification?
* Does size shrink through discovery, or through negotiation?
* Are teams punished for admitting uncertainty?
* Do commitments follow evidence, or optimism?

If size increases risk rather than reducing it, this pattern is not operating.

***

### Relationship to EOM Principles

This pattern reinforces:

* **Learning over Certainty** — confidence only increases through evidence
* **Incremental & Reversible Commitment** — delivery follows learning
* **Evidence over Opinion** — size changes when understanding changes
* **Flow as Signal** — early learning improves downstream flow

***

### Summary

Confidence-Based Sizing reframes estimation as a **learning instrument**, not a planning tool.

It does not answer _“How long will this take?”_\
It answers _“How much do we still not know?”_

When size is allowed to be honest, learning accelerates.\
When learning accelerates, flow follows.

That is the purpose of sizing in an Emergent Operating Model.
