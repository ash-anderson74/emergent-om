# Pattern: Visualise Work

### Context

In complex product environments, work is distributed across teams, functions, and time.\
As complexity increases, understanding how work _actually moves_ through the system becomes progressively harder.

Without shared visibility of work and flow, organisations reason about progress abstractly — through plans, narratives, and status — rather than through evidence.

### Problem

When work is not credibly visualised:

* queues and delays remain hidden
* dependencies are discussed but not exposed
* prioritisation becomes political or anecdotal
* flow problems are misattributed to people rather than system design
* governance relies on reports instead of signals

Work is happening — but the **system producing it is opaque**.

### Forces

* Strategy is often communicated at a level too abstract to guide day-to-day decisions
* Complexity increases faster than management structures adapt
* Reporting artefacts optimise for explanation, not understanding
* Teams optimise locally because system effects are invisible
* Leadership assumes alignment exists because activity is visible

### Solution

Make work and flow **explicit, visible, and discussable** at the level where decisions are made.

Effective work visualisation:

* represents work as it actually flows, not as it is planned
* makes queues, waiting time, and blockage visible
* exposes constraints rather than hiding them behind narrative
* supports local learning before central intervention

The intent is not transparency for its own sake, but **system legibility**.

### Common Realisations of This Pattern

One widely recognised and effective realisation of this pattern is **Kanban**.

Kanban-based systems emphasise:

* explicit visualisation of work and queues
* limits on work in progress
* observation of flow and waiting over time
* continuous, evidence-led improvement

These characteristics align closely with EOM’s intent for work visualisation:

> to make system behaviour visible so it can be reasoned about —\
> not to plan, schedule, or control delivery.

Within EOM, Kanban is understood primarily as a **diagnostic and sensing mechanism**.\
Its value lies in exposing bottlenecks, queues, hand-offs, and imbalance that would otherwise remain invisible, allowing teams and leaders to **see how work actually behaves**.

EOM does **not** mandate Kanban, nor does it define any specific Kanban implementation as canonical.

Other approaches may satisfy this pattern if — and only if — they:

* make work and flow visible end-to-end
* expose constraints rather than smoothing them over
* support learning at the point of decision-making

The criterion is not the tool.

The criterion is whether the **system can be observed, discussed, and adapted**.

### Common Distortions and Misuses

EOM treats the following as warning signs that work visualisation has degraded into theatre:

* boards used solely for task tracking or status reporting
* representations organised around roles or teams rather than flow
* work visualised without explicit limits on concurrency
* artefacts optimised for upward reporting instead of local learning
* visualisations that hide queues, waiting time, or blocked work

In these cases, work may be visible — but the system remains unintelligible.

Visualisation becomes **performative**, not diagnostic.

### Relationship to Other EOM Patterns

Credible work visualisation is foundational to multiple EOM patterns, including:

* **Flow as a Diagnostic, Not a Target**
* **Incremental and Reversible Commitment**
* **Governance as Sensing Rather Than Control**

Without visible work and flow, these patterns collapse into abstraction and retrospective justification.

### Result

When work is credibly visualised:

* constraints surface earlier
* prioritisation shifts from opinion to evidence
* governance intervenes with context rather than surprise
* teams adapt locally without fragmenting system coherence

Adaptation accelerates because reality is no longer obscured.

### Trade-offs

* Discomfort increases as constraints become explicit
* Misalignment becomes visible sooner
* Visual models require maintenance and conversation
* Improvement work becomes unavoidable

* Operate Around Outcomes
* Outcome Over Output
* Flow First
