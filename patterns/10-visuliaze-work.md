# Pattern: Visualise Work

## Context

Teams often struggle to understand how their work connects to broader organizational goals.

Without shared context, effort fragments and alignment erodes.

## Problem

Lack of systemic visibility leads to:

* disconnected priorities
* duplicated effort
* local optimization
* difficulty explaining value
* strategy becoming abstract and distant

Teams execute without understanding why.

## Forces

* Strategy is often communicated abstractly
* Complexity increases with scale
* Visibility tools focus on delivery, not intent
* Leaders assume alignment exists

## Solution

Make strategic intent explicit and visible.

This involves:

* clarifying strategic outcomes
* mapping how work contributes to them
* visualizing hypotheses and dependencies
* connecting team goals to system-level intent

Alignment emerges through shared understanding, not enforcement.

## Common Realisations of This Pattern

One widely recognised way this pattern appears in practice is through **Kanban-based systems**.

Kanban emphasises:

* visual representation of work and queues
* explicit limits on work in progress
* observation of flow over time
* continuous, evidence-led improvement

These characteristics align closely with the Emergent Operating Model’s intent for work visualisation: **to make system behaviour visible so it can be reasoned about, rather than to control or schedule delivery**.

Within EOM, Kanban is understood primarily as a **diagnostic and sensing mechanism**, not as a delivery framework. Its value lies in exposing bottlenecks, queues, hand-offs, and imbalances that would otherwise remain hidden, allowing teams and leaders to observe how work actually flows through the system.

Importantly, EOM does **not** mandate Kanban, nor does it define any specific Kanban implementation as canonical. Other approaches may satisfy this pattern if they make work, flow, and constraints equally visible and support learning at the point of decision-making.

The criterion is not the tool.

The criterion is whether the system can be **seen, discussed, and adapted**.

### Common Misuses of Work Visualisation

EOM treats the following as warning signs that the pattern is being distorted:

* visual boards used solely for task tracking or status reporting
* representations organised around roles or teams rather than flow
* work visualised without explicit limits on concurrency
* boards optimised for upward reporting rather than local learning
* visualisation that hides queues, waiting time, or blocked work

In these cases, work may be visible without the system being understandable. \
Visualisation becomes performative rather than diagnostic.

### Relationship to Other EOM Patterns

Work visualisation underpins several other EOM patterns, including:

* **Flow as a Diagnostic, Not a Target**
* **Incremental and Reversible Commitment**
* **Governance as Sensing Rather Than Control**

Without credible visualisation of work and flow, these patterns collapse into abstraction or retrospective justification.

***

### Summary

Visualising work is not about transparency for its own sake.

It is about **making constraints, delays, and trade-offs observable**, so learning can inform decisions before irreversible commitments are made.

Kanban is a common and well-established way this pattern manifests.

It is not the only way.

What matters is that work — and the system producing it — can no longer hide.

## Result

* Teams see how their work matters
* Prioritization becomes easier
* Strategy becomes tangible
* Adaptation preserves coherence

## Trade-offs

* Requires ongoing conversation
* Visual models must evolve
* Misalignment becomes visible sooner
