# Pattern: Operate Around Outcomes

### Context

As organisations grow, coordination costs rise.

Leaders seek alignment through:

* shared plans
* standardised delivery models
* synchronised cadences
* dependency-managed roadmaps

These mechanisms initially provide clarity, but increasingly create drag.

### Problem

Coordination mechanisms drift toward **control**:

* decisions must pass through multiple layers
* changes require re-approval
* learning invalidates plans, but plans still dominate
* teams optimise for predictability rather than value

The organisation becomes aligned — but brittle.

### EOM Perspective

In the Emergent Operating Model, **alignment is not achieved by orchestration**.

It emerges when:

> multiple teams are independently constrained by the _same outcome intent_\
> and allowed to adapt based on evidence.

Operating around outcomes replaces **plan coherence** with **learning coherence**.

### Forces

* Leaders need confidence and visibility
* Teams need autonomy and speed
* Systems are coupled in unpredictable ways
* Dependencies cannot be fully known upfront

Traditional coordination attempts to resolve these forces _in advance_.

EOM resolves them **continuously**.

### Solution

Design the operating system so that:

* outcomes are explicit and testable
* outcome ownership is clear
* decision authority exists where evidence emerges
* progress is reviewed through learning signals, not task completion

Teams organise their work **around reducing uncertainty related to the outcome**, not around delivering predefined scope.

### Example

Instead of coordinating three teams through a shared migration plan:

* Each team owns a **different outcome constraint**, e.g.:
  * customer continuity
  * operational resilience
  * migration throughput

Coordination occurs through:

* surfaced risks
* learning events
* evolving evidence

—not through dependency sequencing.

### Resulting Behaviours

* teams change approach without escalating permission
* dependencies are exposed through work, not diagrams
* plans evolve without re-baselining theatre
* governance conversations focus on _what we now know_

### Trade-offs

* less upfront certainty
* more visible learning debt
* higher demand on leadership judgement

These are **design choices**, not flaws.

### Anti-Patterns

* outcome language wrapping fixed scope
* shared outcomes without decision authority
* measuring outcomes as targets rather than signals
* reverting to plan-based coordination under pressure

### Relationship to EOM

* Anchors _Outcomes Over Outputs_
* Enables _Empowerment Over Centralised Control_
* Depends on _Incremental & Reversible Commitment_
* Reinforces _Governance as Sensing_
