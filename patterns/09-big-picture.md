# Pattern: Big Picture

## Context

Organizations often struggle to connect day-to-day delivery work with strategic objectives. Teams focus on features or tasks without understanding how their efforts contribute to customer impact or business goals.

## Problem

Without a shared “big picture,” teams operate in silos. Strategic intent gets lost in translation, leading to misaligned priorities, wasted effort, and difficulty demonstrating value.

## Solution

Use **Strategic Outcome Mapping** and **Lean Value Trees (LVTs)** to create a visual, collaborative representation of how strategic goals cascade into measurable outcomes and team-level objectives.

This mapping clarifies:

- **Why the work matters** (strategic intent)
- **What problems are worth solving** (customer and business outcomes)
- **How initiatives and experiments connect to those outcomes**

### Lean Value Trees provide the strategic hierarchy

- Strategic Themes → Bets → Value Streams → Initiatives → OKRs

Prioritized initiatives from LVTs then move into Portfolio Kanban, which visualizes flow across stages and enables leaders to coach through flow—not control through timelines.
Outcome Mapping and LVT sessions typically occur during the **Slowification window (Weeks 1–2)** and feed directly into OKR planning and Portfolio Kanban setup.

## Result

Teams gain clarity on the big picture, align their OKRs with strategic outcomes, and prioritize work that delivers measurable impact. Leadership shifts from prescribing features to enabling **hypothesis-driven, outcome-focused decisions**.

Portfolio Kanban ensures systemic visibility and adaptability, while LVTs maintain strategic coherence across the portfolio.
