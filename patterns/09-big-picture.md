# Pattern: Big Picture

### Context

As organisations scale, work fragments across teams, initiatives, and portfolios.

Without shared context, teams optimise locally while losing sight of system-level intent.

### Problem

When the “big picture” is absent or abstract:

* priorities drift
* work becomes disconnected from strategy
* value is difficult to explain
* alignment relies on enforcement
* teams execute without understanding why

Strategy becomes something that is declared, not something that guides decisions.

### Forces

* Strategy is expressed at too high a level
* Delivery artefacts dominate visibility
* Dependencies obscure intent
* Leaders assume alignment exists
* Change outpaces shared understanding

### Solution

Make **strategic intent visible as a system**, not as a document.

This includes:

* explicit outcomes and hypotheses
* visual connection between work and intent
* visible assumptions and dependencies
* regular re-interpretation based on learning

The big picture is not static — it evolves as understanding grows.

### Result

* Teams understand how their work contributes
* Prioritisation improves without escalation
* Strategy becomes tangible and discussable
* Coherence emerges without uniformity

### Trade-offs

* Requires ongoing conversation
* Visual models must be maintained
* Misalignment becomes visible sooner

* Outcome Over Output
* Visualise Work
* Learning as a System Outcome
