# Roles and Accountabilities

## Purpose

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) defines **accountabilities**, not job titles.

Roles exist to ensure that critical responsibilities are explicitly owned, visible, and exercised within the system. They do not prescribe organizational structure, seniority, or reporting lines.

This section defines a small set of **essential accountabilities** required to operate EOM effectively in complex environments.

***

## Accountability over Role

In EOM:

* A _role_ represents a set of accountabilities
* Accountabilities may be held by one person or shared across multiple people
* A single individual may hold multiple roles
* Titles and reporting structures are intentionally left undefined

This approach prevents role proliferation while preserving clarity of ownership.

***

## Core Accountabilities

The Emergent Operating Model defines three core outcome-oriented accountabilities that operate at different system levels.

### 1. Value Outcome Accountability

**Purpose:**\
Ensure that investment remains aligned to intended outcomes and strategic intent.

**Core Accountabilities:**

* framing strategic bets as outcome-oriented hypotheses
* maintaining clarity of intended value
* assessing outcome progress using evidence
* informing prioritization and funding decisions
* preventing output from substituting for outcomes

This accountability operates primarily at the **portfolio and strategic level**, but maintains visibility into delivery and learning signals.

***

### 2. Team Outcome Accountability

**Purpose:**\
Enable teams to pursue outcomes through discovery, delivery, and continuous learning.

**Core Accountabilities:**

* owning outcomes rather than task completion
* forming and testing hypotheses
* balancing discovery and delivery
* responding to feedback and evidence
* maintaining local flow and quality

This accountability operates at the **team level** and is intentionally empowered within defined guardrails.

***

### 3. Architecture Outcome Accountability

**Purpose:**\
Ensure that the system evolves in a way that sustains flow, reduces risk, and supports long-term adaptability.

**Core Accountabilities:**

* safeguarding system integrity and coherence
* identifying and addressing structural constraints
* guiding architectural evolution incrementally
* enabling teams through shared services and patterns
* balancing short-term delivery pressure with long-term system health

This accountability focuses on **system-wide outcomes**, not control of design decisions.

***

## Relationship Between Accountabilities

The three core accountabilities are **mutually constraining and reinforcing**.

* Value Outcome Accountability clarifies _why_ the organization is investing
* Team Outcome Accountability explores _how_ value may emerge
* Architecture Outcome Accountability ensures the system can sustain that exploration

None of these accountabilities supersede the others.\
Tension between them is expected and treated as a **source of learning**, not dysfunction.

***

## Leadership Responsibilities

The Emergent Operating Model defines leadership by behaviour rather than position.

Leaders are accountable for:

* establishing and protecting clear purpose
* creating conditions for learning and psychological safety
* reinforcing outcome-oriented thinking
* modeling curiosity over certainty
* removing systemic impediments

Leadership is exercised throughout the system, not confined to hierarchical roles.

***

## Governance Boundaries and Guardrails

Roles and accountabilities operate within explicit guardrails defined through governance and funding mechanisms.

Guardrails typically include:

* financial boundaries
* decision rights
* transparency expectations
* escalation paths for systemic risk

Within these boundaries, accountability holders are empowered to adapt their approach based on learning.

***

## Anti-Patterns

The following patterns indicate misuse of roles and accountabilities:

* assigning accountability without authority
* treating roles as job descriptions
* centralizing decision-making while decentralizing responsibility
* using roles to enforce compliance
* resolving cross-role tension through hierarchy rather than learning

These patterns undermine adaptability and should be addressed at the system level.

***

## Summary

The Emergent Operating Model uses roles to ensure **clear ownership without rigid structure**.

By defining outcome-oriented accountabilities rather than prescriptive positions, the operating system enables:

* alignment without control
* autonomy without fragmentation
* leadership without hierarchy
* coordination without ceremony

Roles exist to serve the system, not to stabilize organizational charts.
