# Core Domains

Each domain within the operating system represents a dimension of adaptation – where change, learning, and alignment occur in a complex socio-technical system.

| Domain | Focus | Core Question | Primary Levers |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Direction & Purpose | Strategy and shared outcomes | Why are we adapting? | Mission clarity, adaptive strategy, outcome definition, sensing mechanisms |
| Leadership & Culture | Behaviours, values, and psychological conditions | How do we lead and learn together? | Leadership models, decision rights, trust, learning culture, psychological safety |
| Product & Value Creation | Discovery, delivery, and validation of value | How do we create and evolve value continuously? | Product operating model, empowered teams, discovery practices, outcome metrics |
| Flow & Enablement | Technical and organizational infrastructure for adaptability | How do we make adaptation possible and safe? | Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, automation, architecture, toolchains, system design for flow |
| Learning & Sensing | Feedback loops and systemic learning | How do we know what is working and what is not? | Retrospectives, reflection, experimentation, data feedback, sensing networks |

## Domain Relationships

These domains are interdependent and cyclic rather than hierarchical:
