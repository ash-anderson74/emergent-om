# When not to use the Emergent Operating Model

## Purpose

The Emergent Operating Model (EOM) is intentionally scoped.

This section defines **contexts in which EOM is not an appropriate operating system**, or where its use should be limited, deferred, or complemented by other approaches.

Making these boundaries explicit protects both the organization and the integrity of the operating system.

***

## Deterministic or Low-Uncertainty Work

The Emergent Operating Model is not suited as the primary operating model for work that is:

* highly repeatable
* governed by stable requirements
* dominated by known solutions
* optimizable through standardization
* constrained primarily by execution efficiency

In such contexts, deterministic planning, fixed-scope execution, and efficiency-focused management are often more effective and lower-cost.

EOM may still coexist in adjacent areas where uncertainty exists, but should not displace fit-for-purpose operating models.

***

## Compliance-Dominated Environments

The Emergent Operating Model should not be used where:

* compliance requirements strictly constrain change
* deviation from predefined procedures is prohibited
* learning cycles are overridden by regulatory mandates
* outcomes are defined solely by adherence to rules

In these environments, EOM principles may inform improvement efforts, but governance must remain anchored to compliance obligations.

***

## Organizations Seeking Certainty Over Learning

The Emergent Operating Model is not appropriate where leadership:

* requires detailed upfront commitments in uncertain domains
* equates control with predictability
* treats deviation from plan as failure
* is unwilling to adapt strategy based on evidence

Adopting EOM without tolerance for learning and adaptation increases risk and frustration.

***

## Tool-Driven or Framework-Substitution Efforts

The Emergent Operating Model should not be adopted as:

* a replacement for delivery frameworks
* a branding exercise
* a tool selection initiative
* a maturity model
* a compliance checklist

Using EOM in this way undermines its purpose and reduces it to performative change.

***

## Rapid Standardization and Scale-First Mandates

The Emergent Operating Model is not designed for contexts where:

* speed of uniform rollout outweighs learning
* local adaptation is discouraged
* standardization precedes evidence
* deviation from prescribed practice is penalized

EOM favours coherence through shared principles over uniformity through enforced standards.

***

## Absence of Psychological Safety

The Emergent Operating Model relies on transparency, experimentation, and honest feedback.

Where:

* failure is punished
* metrics are used punitively
* learning is discouraged
* speaking up carries risk

EOM practices will likely be gamed or suppressed rather than used effectively.

***

## Using the Emergent Operating Model as a Target State

The Emergent Operating Model is not a goal to be reached.

Using it as:

* a future-state blueprint
* a destination architecture
* a maturity target

creates rigidity and false closure.

EOM is intended to evolve with its environment and organization.

***

## Misalignment with Organizational Incentives

The Emergent Operating Model should not be imposed where incentives:

* reward output over outcomes
* prioritize utilization over learning
* favor short-term predictability over adaptation
* penalize cross-boundary collaboration

Without aligned incentives, EOM behaviors will not sustain.

***

## Partial Adoption Without Acknowledgment

The Emergent Operating Model can be adopted incrementally, but should not be applied:

* without acknowledging its assumptions
* without making trade-offs explicit
* while simultaneously reinforcing contradictory mechanisms

Unacknowledged contradictions reduce coherence and increase frustration.

***

## Summary

The Emergent Operating Model is effective only when its assumptions match the operating context.

It should not be used as:

* a universal solution
* a compliance framework
* a substitute for leadership judgment

Where uncertainty is low, compliance dominates, or learning is not valued, other operating models are more appropriate.

Choosing not to use EOM in these contexts is a sign of good judgment, not failure.
