# Core Principles

EmergentOS is built upon **eight core principles** (and one supporting principle):

1. **Outcome-Driven Planning**

- Delivery is aligned to **customer outcomes**, not feature roadmaps.
- **Lean Value Trees (LVTs)** provide the strategic map, breaking down themes into bets and initiatives.
- Teams use **OKRs** to focus on measurable impact and strategic alignment.
- Planning is quarterly, adaptive, and based on **validated learning—not estimates**.

2. **Hypothesis-Driven Strategy**

- Every initiative starts with a **clear hypothesis** and **expected outcome**.
- Hypotheses are validated through **discovery and experimentation** before commitment.
- This approach reduces waste and ensures adaptability.

3. **Team-Centric Autonomy**

- Teams are stream-aligned, cross-functional, and empowered to own outcomes.
- Decision-making is decentralized, supported by **Team Topologies** and clear interaction modes.
- Autonomy is balanced with strategic clarity through shared rituals and coaching.

4. **Flow-Based Delivery**

- Work is visualized and managed through **Kanban**, with WIP limits and flow metrics.
- Delivery is iterative, emphasizing thin slices, experimentation, and telemetry.
- **Portfolio Kanban** enables leaders to coach through flow—not control through timelines.

5. **Continuous Improvement**

- Teams run **Lean Kata cycles** and use **Flow Engineering** to identify and address systemic blockers.
- Improvement work is tracked as OKRs and reviewed quarterly alongside delivery goals.
- Learning is embedded into the rhythm of delivery—not treated as a separate activity.

6. **Engineering Excellence**

- Practices like **CI/CD**, trunk-based development, and infrastructure-as-code enable fast, safe delivery.
- **DORA metrics** provide empirical insight into engineering health and guide coaching.
- Technical quality is maintained through telemetry, automated testing, and safe deployment strategies.

7. **Empirical Governance**

- Governance is **lightweight, developmental**, and **data-driven**.
- Leaders guide teams using **flow metrics, DORA trends, and validated outcomes—not timelines or estimates**.
- Coaching-led governance includes OKR reviews, strategy refreshes, and coaching playbooks.

8. **Sustainable Pace and Resilience**

- The principle of **Slowification** ensures teams invest in planning, learning, and self-care.
- Delivery is paced to avoid burnout and support long-term performance.
- Teams are encouraged to pause, reflect, and improve continuously.

9. **Methodology Flexibility**

   Within the quarterly cadence of EmergentOS, teams are fully empowered to choose and apply any delivery methodology—Agile or otherwise—that best suits their context.

   The guiding principle is **adaptability**:

- If learning reveals that a chosen method impedes flow or limits outcomes, teams should evolve or replace it.
- EmergentOS provides scaffolding for this evolution through **empirical governance**, **coaching-led support**, and **modular practices**.
