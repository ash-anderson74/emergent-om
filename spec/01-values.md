# Values

1. **Outcome Over Output**  
We prioritize measurable impact over activity. Success is defined by the change we create—not the volume we deliver.
2. **Empowered Autonomy**  
Teams are trusted to own their outcomes, make decisions, and learn through experimentation. Leadership enables, not controls.
3. **Evidence-Driven Learning**  
We make decisions based on data, telemetry, and validated discovery—not assumptions or estimates. Learning is continuous and embedded.
4. **Flow and Focus**  
We optimize flow, reduce friction, and visualize work to stay focused on what matters. Bottlenecks are surfaced and addressed collaboratively.
5. **Sustainable Pace**  
We deliver at a resilient rhythm that supports long-term performance, wellbeing, and innovation. Slowification is a strategic investment.
6. **Strategic Alignment**  
Every initiative is connected to a clear strategic outcome. Lean Value Trees visualize the hierarchy of strategic themes, bets, and initiatives, while OKRs guide priorities and measure impact. Together, they ensure work is traceable to business value, adaptable as new insights emerge, and focused on solving the right problems—not just delivering outputs.
7. **Coaching Culture**  
Leaders act as coaches, fostering growth, clarity, and capability. Governance is developmental, not directive.
8. **Modular Adaptability**  
We evolve continuously. Practices are composable, scalable, and tailored to team maturity and context.
9. **Customer-Centricity**  
We solve real problems for real people. Customer outcomes are the north star of our planning, delivery, and improvement.
10. **Transparency and Trust**  
Work is visible, progress is shared, and decisions are made openly. Trust is built through clarity and accountability.
11. **Hypothesis-Driven Strategy**  
We treat strategy as a series of bets, not certainties. Every initiative starts with a clear hypothesis and expected outcome, validated through discovery and learning before commitment. This ensures adaptability and reduces waste.
