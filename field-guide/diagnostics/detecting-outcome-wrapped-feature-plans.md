# PM Diagnostic: Detecting Outcome-Wrapped Feature Plans

This diagnostic is a **sense-making aid**, not a set of rules or best practices.

Its purpose is to help Product Managers notice when work that appears outcome-oriented is, in practice, being planned and governed as deterministic feature delivery — particularly during platform rewrites, legacy replacement, or migration programmes.

The pattern it helps detect is the **Outcome-Wrapped Feature Plans** anti-pattern.

### How to Use This Diagnostic

Read the questions slowly.

You are not looking for perfect answers — you are looking for **signals**.

If most answers cluster on the same side, the system is already telling you how it expects you to behave.

***

### 1. How Is Progress Framed?

**Signals of outcome-orientation:**

* Progress conversations centre on **problem reduction**, risk retired, or uncertainty resolved
* Stopping, pivoting, or reshaping work is discussed neutrally
* Learning milestones are discussed before delivery milestones

**Signals of feature determinism:**

* Progress is primarily described as “X% complete”
* Success equals “everything we planned was delivered”
* Learning appears only as justification after slippage

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x49;f delivery stopped tomorrow, would we still be able to explain what we now understand better than before?_

***

### 2. What Actually Gets Estimated?

**Signals of learning-led planning:**

* Only near-term work is estimated
* Estimates are revisited frequently
* Estimates are explicitly described as provisional

**Signals of feature-led planning:**

* Large bodies of work are estimated upfront
* Estimates are treated as commitments
* Re-estimation is treated as failure

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x41;re estimates primarily used to learn — or to secure permission?_

***

### 3. How Are Dependencies Discussed?

**Signals of outcome-driven thinking:**

* Dependencies are framed as risks to be reduced
* Teams actively reshape scope to reduce coupling
* Delay is treated as a signal to redesign flow

**Signals of feature sequencing:**

* Dependencies appear as fixed constraints
* Plans assume “everyone will be ready on time”
* Slippage propagates silently across teams

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x41;re dependencies something we work to eliminate — or something we plan around?_

***

### 4. What Happens When Assumptions Break?

**Signals of learning-centred behaviour:**

* Assumptions are explicitly named
* Invalidated assumptions are treated as useful
* Plans are adjusted without escalation theatre

**Signals of outcome-wrapped features:**

* Assumptions are implicit
* Surprises trigger defensive explanation
* The plan survives longer than the evidence

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x49;s it socially and structurally safe to say “this turned out to be wrong”?_

***

### 5. How Is Scope Allowed to Change?

**Signals of outcome focus:**

* Scope is treated as negotiable
* Alternative paths are explored openly
* Scope reduction is viewed as progress

**Signals of feature fixation:**

* Scope is treated as fixed once agreed
* Trade-offs are hidden inside teams
* Scope reduction requires justification

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x49;s changing scope easier than changing dates?_

***

### 6. What Do Roadmaps Actually Communicate?

**Signals of outcome-led intent:**

* Roadmaps express problems, risks, or hypotheses
* Timing bands express confidence, not certainty
* Removal of items is considered healthy

**Signals of deterministic planning:**

* Roadmaps list features with dates
* Time implies confidence that does not exist
* Items “move right” but rarely disappear

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x44;oes the roadmap describe uncertainty — or hide it?_

***

### 7. How Are Teams Rewarded (Formally or Informally)?

**Signals of learning alignment:**

* Stopping early is recognised as competence
* Quality of insight is discussed explicitly
* Teams are not penalised for disproving ideas

**Signals of delivery bias:**

* Reward follows visible output
* Stopped work is quietly reframed as failure
* Hitting commitments matters more than insight gained

> **Diagnostic prompt:**\
> &#xNAN;_&#x57;hat behaviour would someone repeat if they wanted to be seen as successful here?_

***

### Interpreting the Result

If most of your answers fall on the **feature-led** side:

* This is not a PM capability problem
* It is not a mindset gap
* It is the rational response to a system optimised for predictability

If most fall on the **learning-led** side:

* Deterministic techniques may still be appropriate locally
* But they are being used within a learning-governed system, not as defaults

The purpose of this diagnostic is **not to remove features from planning**, but to prevent features from becoming **surrogates for certainty**.

### Closing Note

Feature delivery is sometimes necessary.\
Feature determinism is rarely justified under uncertainty.

This diagnostic helps Product Managers notice when planning has quietly crossed that line — so the system can be adjusted _before_ behaviour needs correcting.
